            <p><b class="opening-quote">&#8220;</b><br>Despite my interest in biology back in highschool, I decided to be a premed when I applied to UC Davis majoring in Biological Sciences under parental influence and seeing what my peers did. It wasn't something I wanted from the bottom of my heart but merely a reflection of outside expectations and my desire to follow a safe path. Compared to other premed students who are determined to save lives or help people in certain areas, be it psychology, neurology, or cardiology, I only had a passion in biology and physiology but with no clear goals. I thought to myself every single day what I was going to write on my medical school application to the question "Why do you want to be a doctor?" None of my reasons felt convincing, even to myself.<br><b class="closing-quote">&#8221;</b></p>

            <p><b class="opening-quote">&#8220;</b><br>I felt so anxious that I decided to have a backup plan in case I don't get into medical school. But this ended up being an even worse decision, since my backup plan is to become a software engineer. It was the most popular job and the most lucrative career for college graduates, according to google, and everywhere I searched they recommended this major to be full of potential and opportunities. So I made my decision to double major in computer science in addition to biology. I searched for so many sources online and asked so many people externally, but I forgot to look inwards and left my own heart behind. However, I do appreciate how I provided myself with more options in the future by changing into this double major.<br><b class="closing-quote">&#8221;</b></p>

            <p><b class="opening-quote">&#8220;</b><br>This turned out to be the most difficult thing to do, learning coding from scratch with peers that have started coding in middle school, and competing with premed students in cut throat classes such as biology and chemistry where exams had little to no curves. I drained myself in two majors that I didn't know why I majored in, resulting in a lack of interest. I watched my grades suffer as I tried to balance life, participate in premed volunteering, plan for future, decide on my career goals, while double majoring in two of the most difficult majors. I watched my GPA suffer to the point where I  have "no chance" getting into my dream [competitive] medical school anymore. I questioned myself. I was depressed. My parents were concerned.<br><b class="closing-quote">&#8221;</b></p>

I have always been passionate at drawing and artistic activities, such as customizing sneakers, designing logos, and painting portraits. Despite being the president of my high school Art club, I never previously considered having a career utilizing this creative strength of mine, because I have been indoctrinated that artists related careers result in starvation and begging.

This interdisciplinary field covers all three fields that I'm interested in or have expereince in â€“ my passion in creative work, my interest in biology, and my coursework in computer science. "THIS IS IT!!!" I thought, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.

He invited me to check out his workspace and I saw walls with brainstorm stickers for user flows. He also showed me his desktop, some common apps UX Designers use, and set me up with a meeting with his Product Manager. I was able to ask a lot of questions that are hard to find answers online, and seeing his workflow inspired me a lot.
