    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <p><em>Project Summary</em></p>
    <p>The topic of my project is about cultural identity. It will be a responsive viewport that aim to prompt viewers to reflect on the meaning of various identities, empathize with others' perspectives, and eventually decrease cultural racism by letting viewers read through my own and Eileen Gu's stories, as well as the response and read interaction with other viewers.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p><em>Project Goals</em></p>
    <p>The goal of my project is to decrease cultural racism and foster more understanding between people from different backgrounds. </p>
    <div></div>
    <p><em>Design Strategies</em></p>
    <p>I will format the visual style of the website to hold a narrative style, with darker background colors to generate an immersive effect. To achieve a narrative style, I will use serif fonts to lay out stories and concepts that feel like books.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p><em>Interaction Strategies</em></p>
    <p>The interaction design of prompting users to input and read other's responses will be curated towards empathy and mutual learnings. Users will only be able to see others' responses if they have entered their own thoughts, as a means of fostering communication and thought-exchange.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p><em>Experience Goals: Articulate your goals for intended/desired experiences for the users and how you plan to achieve them.</em></p>
    <p>The experience will start off with a receive phase: reading two stories about cultural identity and cultural racism, then goes into a respond phase: users share their thoughts on what identity, nationality, culture mean to them.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p><em>Users</em></p>
    <p>Everybody is welcome to view the website, but I hope this website could provide some emotional support, inspiration, and validation for cross-cultural kids such as immigrants, biracial people, TCKs, etc. I also hope people with internalized cultural racism would be able to reflect upon their beliefs and bias.</p>
