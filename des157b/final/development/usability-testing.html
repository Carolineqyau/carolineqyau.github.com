    <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
    <p>My goal for the user testing is to see whether this website achieved my goal of providing viewers with a collective memory of options dealing with identity and having them understand cultural racism. I would like to conduct a user study with the least interference, in order to mimic an environment similar to when a viewer first lands on my page. I want to observe and record the user’s behavior to check what part of my website has usability issues, and if the user’s interpretation of tasks/actions is different from what I prompted and have in mind (i.e, reading the flow, responding to the 3 questions and reading others’ responses, and reading the resources). I also want to check my assumptions on the helpfulness of resources.</p>
    <p>So, I will let users land on the website page, and observe how they go through the page. For example, I might notice that they spend very little time during the My Story section, then that might indicate that it is not very attention-grabbing nor interesting to read about.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p>Questions to ask after they finish viewing and responding to the website:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>How was your experience reading the introduction and stories? (engaging/thought-provoking or not)</li>
        <li>Were the questions articulated clearly? What did you think each question was asking about?</li>
        <li>Are the resources helpful/unhelpful or not? How can I make it more helpful for different types of audiences?</li>
        <li>What was your view on identity before interacting with this website? Has it changed after viewing information and others’ responses on this website?</li>
        <li>Do you understand what cultural racism/cultural antiracism is? Have you experienced it before?</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Findings from Usability Testing</em></p>
    <p>Don’t need a page structure, include a title or logo. Unify by keeping it consistent. The Eileen Gu section was confusing, make it contextualized. The screenshot about her controversy looks like a link to the signing the petition.Allow viewers to click to move to the next page of progress. When viewers submit form, I should add Event.addpreventdefault.</p>
    <p>Big picture: How has culture, identity and culture affected you? Share… Start with what my project is about, load with cultural racism. Use the structure of your story, our stories… to amplify definition of these topic areas.</p> 
    <p>Are resources not necessary? Effects that that could have on someone. List 5 resources. Identity workshops, with each question, the screen shows a multiplicity of the answers. Impact is gonna come once you fill in the stories. Allow viewers to share their stories. Have 1 question about personal experience, 1 question about the whole website. The current questions arent so personal to the user, so it does not cause enough impact and not let viewers think deeply enough about the questions. Not as deep as it can go. Will help if there is a personal question. One of the reviewers said he prefers immediate gratification such as being able to see others' answers, rather than thinking 'How many do I need to answer until I can see others' responses?'" Instead of throwing definitions, maybe have a definition choice.</p>
