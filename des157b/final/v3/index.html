                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In the past and present, we have been using race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, etc. to define our identities. But they continue to be less and less applicable and relevant in today's world as fewer truly monocultural communities exist. United States have been a melting pot for years, yet we still tend to singularly label people with race as the dominating identity, which has become a major social issue.</p>

                <h2>Thoughts...</h2>
                <p>We are commonly labeled by our race and ethnicity. As the world becomes more and more interconnected, with more and more cross-cultural kids (CCKs) – people who have meaningfully interacted with two or more cultural environments for a significant period of time during developmental year, for example children of immigrants, international adoptees, children of refugees, bi-racial and multicultural-cultural children – has this labeling system become obsolete? How do we fully represent our identity?</p>

                <h2>My Story with Cultural Racism...</h2>
                <p>I went to an international elementary school in Beijing, where my peers were all cross cultural kids, primarily American born asians, citizens from all around the world, and a lot of mixed people who were half Chinese. </p>
                <p>My elementary school peers were the epitome of cultural racists, they placed Chinese culture at the bottom of their cultural hierarchy, and anything other than Chinese was above it, such as Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Nigerian culture, and white American pop culture was the golden standard, it was the most superior culture, and people judged others based on how well they know or assimilate to it. For instance, I've been bullied for not knowing what Hannah Montana and Justin Bieber were, or being bad at football, in which my peers commented “You’re so Chinese” to me as an insult. As a result, the adjective “Chinese” was a devaluing description, and it resulted in my identity crisis due to experiencing this cultural racism in my early developmental years.</p>

                <h2>Eileen Gu and Cultural Antiracism</h2>
                <img src="images/eileen-medal.JPG" alt="Eileen with gold medal">
                <p>10 years later, however, we see another cross-cultural kid Eileen Gu making a completely opposite, culturally antiracist decision when it comes to her identity. Eileen Gu is a half Chinese and half Caucasian skier. She was raised by her single Chinese mother and grandmother in San Francisco, and she visits China every summer.</p>
                <p>Eileen Gu’s controversy started when she announced she will be competing for team China instead of USA for the 2022 Winter Olympics: <i>“I am proud of my heritage and equally proud of my American upbringing. The opportunity to help inspire millions of young people where my mom was born, during the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love. Through skiing, I hope to unite people, promote common understanding, create communication, and forge friendships between nations. If I can help to inspire one young girl to break a boundary, my wishes will have come true.”</i></p>
                <img src="images/eileen-skiing.JPG" alt="Eileen skiing">
                <p>Since then, she has been constantly receiving backlashes from mainstream media like the BBC. A news reporter of Fox News called her a traitor for the money. The economist photoshopped her skiing pictures into racist images, like picking her up with chopsticks, and making her ski through mountains of cash in an uncomfortable color scheme. These all exemplify the cultural racism in our mainstream media or society, as mainstream media cannot interpret people’s feeling of belonging to what they consider a more “inferior” culture.</p>

                <img src="images/eileen-money.jpeg" alt="Eileen skiing on top of cash mountains">
                <p>After receiving two gold medals and one silver, almost 7000 people have signed a petition to urge Stanford to revoke Eileen Gu’s Admission this fall. This illustrates the difficulties cross-cultural people face when trying to embrace a culture lower down the hierarchy in mainstream media.</p>
                <p>Eileen Gu spoke in one of her recent interviews that she is Chinese when she’s in China, and American when she’s in the US. She said there’s no one path that fits her well, so she’s going to forge her own way. Personally, I found her way of dealing with cultural and national identities to be very inspiring, and it gave me relief to the cultural racist experience I had in elementary school. I feel motivated to be prouder and embracing and feeling belonging to both of my cultural identities.</p>
                <p>Eileen Gu connects to many who embrace multi-cultural backgrounds. I believe her experience of forging her own path would inspire many other TCKs and CCKs, instead of the old ways of having to choose one to conform to.</p>
