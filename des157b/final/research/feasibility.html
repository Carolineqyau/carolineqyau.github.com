    <h1>Feasibility Report</h1>
    <p><em>A list of features I plan to include.</em></p>
    <p>I plan to include a story section for the users to read, followed by a response section where I present question prompts to users that invite inputs which will be allowed to edit or delete. Then, users can see other people's responses to the prompts. At last, there will be a discussion section where I present a recap of the journeyso far and provide helpful ideas on this topic that users may support, validate, or foster reflection and empathy for the users.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p><em>The technologies required to build each feature.</em></p>
    <p>The story section would only require HTML, CSS, and either the AOS, FullPage, or Rellax library for immersive storytelling. The response section would involve javascript and back4app to save the data and allow timely editing or deletion. The reading others' response section would also require javascript, back4app, and P5 in order to display the responses as randomly floating chat bubbles.</p>
    <div></div>
    <p><em>Skill level assessment.</em></p>
    <p>I am pretty skilled with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've used AOS in three of my projects and rellax in one of my project, so I am also familiar with those. I have been encountering problems with FullPage and it also cannot be concurrently used with AOS as they interfere with each other, so I might research some other fullpage scroll options to support AOS. I am not skilled at Back4App, but I will be able to reasonably be skilled enough within the timeframe of the project. I am pretty skilled coding in Processing, so I might also need some time getting myself familiar with coding with P5 and I believe that is reasonable.</p>
