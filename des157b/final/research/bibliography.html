    <p><em>Van Reken, R. E. (n.d.). Who are Third Culture Kids (TCKs)? Cross Cultural Kids. Retrieved February 11, 2022, from https://www.crossculturalkid.org/who-are-cross-cultural-kids/</em></p>
    <p>David C. Pollock developed the Third Culture Kid (TCK) profile, defining people who have spent a significant part of their developmental years outside the parents' culture(s). The article mentioned that TCKs experience rootlesness in which they belong everywhere and nowhere. The sense of belonging to them is often in relationship to others of similar background rather than shared race or ethnicity alone. It also broke down two major challenges that TCKs experience, one is "cultural marginality", where people don't fit in perfectly into any one of the cultures they have interacted with, but may fit comfortably on the edge and in the margins of each. The second challenge is "unresolved grief", where many of their losses are not visible or recognized by others. The article also provides a helpful breakdown table comparing the differences across TCKs, children of immigrants, international adoptees, children of refugees, bi-racial/bi-cultural childre, etc. The analysis of how Cross-Cultural Children's (CCKs, people who has meaningfully interacted with two or more cultural environments for a significant period of time during developmental years) relationship to surrounding dominant culture in terms of four categories: the foreigner, the hidden immigrant, the adopted, and the mirror, are very interesting. My favorite part about this article is that it brings up our old ways (or normal ways) of defining identity, using race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, etc., but they continue to be less and less applicable and relevant in today's world as fewer truly monocultural communities exist. United States have been a melting pot for years, yet we still tend to label people with race as the dominating identity, which has become a major social issue.</p>

    <p><em>Diversity toolkit: A guide to discussing identity, power and privilege: MSW@USC. USC. (2021, March 22). Retrieved February 11, 2022, from https://msw.usc.edu/mswusc-blog/diversity-workshop-guide-to-discussing-identity-power-and-privilege/</em></p>
    <p>Here's a workshop I found that discusses identity, power and privilege. It provides the technical definition of race - based on national origin, sociocultural groups and self-identification. In addition, the workshop inspired me to brainstorm ways I would ask my viewers to respond, for example the workshop included an activity where people write the top three identities they feel closest to; share any meanings, significance, culture, significant ancestors and the top three identities they hold dearest. For my project, I am planning on asking "What makes up your identity?", "How would you define nationality?", "What does culture mean to you?", and "Who gave you your name (could be yourself) and what does it mean?". Or, it could be more open-ended, like "Identity is...", "Nationality is...", "Culture is...", "What meaning does a person's name have?" Perhaps I might also have an empathetic response section where they respond the previous questions in regards to other people, for example an immigrant, a bi-racial person, or a TCK person. I also got some helpful tips such as "sharing your stories first - making yourself vulnerable will make others more comforatble doing the same" that I will integrate into my narrative for the final project. For example, I might first share my experience, then say "so that's my story, how about yours?"</p>

    <p><em>Kendi, I. (2019). How to be an antiracist. Bodley Head.</em></p>
    <p>Kendi defined "cultural racist" as one who is creating a cultural standard and imposing a cultural hierarchy among racial groups. This is something I have personally experienced in my upbringing, I went to an international elementary school in Beijing and all the kids had a non-Chinese nationality (e.g. American, Canadian, Britain, Belgium, Russian, Japanese) The cultural hierarchy put kids who are the closest to American white culture at the top, such as popular shows like Hannah Montana, pop singers like Lady Gaga, sports like Football, and would look down on people who are not familiar with this culture. Chinese culture was placed at the bottom of the hierarchy, interpreted as unfashionable, ugly ethnically, etc. "You're so Chinese" was a way of insulting people, "Chinese kids" was a devaluing description. I internalized this cultural racism when I moved to an international middle school in Beijing with 99% of my peers with a Chinese nationality. I was "stuck" in the group that my elementary school looked down the most, and by assimilating to American white pop culture throughout my elementary school years, I felt more connected to my elementary schoolmates than my new Chinese classmates. I considered my new classmates as "unfashionable, immature, and ugly." This could be integrated to my Final Project leading towards the Eileen Gu controversy in the United States, since this cultural racism explains some of the hate and misinterpretations of her motives such as "she's a sell out, for the money" that Eileen receives due to cultural racists who are not able to understand Eileen connecting to Chinese culture more than American culture, due to viewing Chinese culture as inferior.</p>

    <p><em>Collins, A. S. (2022, February 10). Verify: Can an athlete compete for a country other than the one they were born in during the Olympics? wcnc.com. Retrieved February 11, 2022, from https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/verify/verify-can-an-athlete-compete-for-a-country-other-than-the-one-they-were-born-in-during-the-olympics/275-ed7ade2d-ac5f-4847-819c-7bf8400ffadc</em></p>
    <p>The Eileen Gu controversy got many people thinking about personal identity, cultural identity, nationality, and what heritage means to them. Many critics commented that Eileen is committing an illegal act, so can an athlete compete for a country other than the one they were born in during the Olympics? The definition of Nationality from Oxford Languages is: 1. the status of belonging to a particular nation and 2. Others interpret nationality as the legal citizenship of a nation state. This article provided an inspection of the Olympics' rules (International Olympic Committee (IOC)) and China's Nationality Law regarding citizenship and nationality, and according to our current information, the answer to the question is yes. The article also provided Eileen Gu's own quotes explaining her decision, "I have decided to compete for China in the upcoming 2022 Winter Olympics. This was an incredibly tough decision for me to make. I am extremely thankful for U.S. Ski & Snowboard ( @usfreeskiteam ) and the Chinese Ski Association for having the vision and belief in me to make my dreams come true. I am proud of my heritage and equally proud of my American upbringing. The opportunity to help inspire millions of young people where my mom was born, during the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love. Through skiing, I hope to unite people, promote common understanding, create communication, and forge friendships between nations. If I can help to inspire one young girl to break a boundary, my wishes will have come true." As she spoke in one of her recent interviews, she said that "Im Chinese when I'm in China, and American when I'm in the US." This inspired me to try to be braver, embrace both of my cultural identities, representing both, and feeling belonging to both. Being a mixed person as half Chinese and half Caucasian, and having spent 30% of her life in China and the other 70% in the United States, Eileen Gu connects to many of us who embrace multi-cultural backgrounds. I believe her experience of forging her own way of identity would inspire many other TCKs and CCKs, instead of the old ways of having to choose one to conform to.</p>
