        <h1>Project Summary</h1>
        <p>A major part of UX is user research, understanding user needs and preferences, as well as making comparisons between features. User survey is one of the popular methods to gather insight about target audiences, and I would like to create a website that makes user surveys easy to conduct for UX Designers and easy to fill for users.</p>

            <h2>Google Form Comparison</h2>
            <p>One of the most used survey websites. Google Form is compatible with other Google tools such as Sheets; Response from google forms can be automatically recorded on Google Sheets. The features are also pretty thorough and it is easy to set up questions. Many job applications use Google Forms as well. It is difficult to have a larger user base than Google Form, but I can introduce new useful features that it doesn't have and also make the UI more visually pleasing and possibly prompt users to look at it more.</p>
            <h2>Survey Monkey Comparison</h2>
            <p>Survey Monkey runs online questionnaires and operates on a freemium business model. While Google Form is used to be sent to a specific audience to respond, Survey Monkey can reach and target a large group of people that is less specific. The interface is more confusing and complicated which is intimidating to use, and advanced features require payment. I intend to create a more user friendly interface.</p>
            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>Create a survey that has useful features, is visually attractive and user friendly. Possibly have an edge over competing products by providing features or aspect that they don't have and creating improvements.</p>
            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>Clean look with a welcoming color scheme and illustrations. User friendly locations of buttons and fill areas to make the process intuitive.</p>
            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>Interactive effects when users fill the forms. Automatic animations when users land on the page. Thankful message when users finish a survey.</p>
            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>Easy to use, intuitive and visually pleasing to users, wow-factor for survey conductors. Show survey progress and number of questions for users.Allow question number to be hidden by the researcher.</p>
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>Anyone who needs to conduct surveys or answer surveys. This includes psychology professionals, UX researchers, students, and human resource managers.</p>
