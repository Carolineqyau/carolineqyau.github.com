            <h1>1. Is the color scheme inviting and pleasing to the eye?</h1>
            <p>Lim responded that it is calming and helped set the tone/vibes.</p>
            <p>Jiayi said that it is natural and comforting.</p>
            <p>Darren replied yes and that it made him curious about more context. Orange and lavender purple look nice. Horizontal change would make filling out the form more interactive and create another start and end experience. Having something on the right side would be beneficial. Eyes drawn to the right. Either centering and enlarging the form or add another section on the right. Have a progress bar such as 1/4 or tell users the stages.</p>
            <h1>2. Is anything confusing?</h1>
            <p>Lim said that questions were vague throughout the process of filling out the form, and she wasn't sure what the survey was asking. The spectrum for answers was unclear. Questions need to be more specific, with some kind of introduction or guidelines. It should demonstrate what the user is filling out and why users should be giving out their information.</p>
            <p>Jiayi responded that the right side of the webpage is empty and confusing.</p>
            <p>Darren replied that it was straightforward. The color for placeholder could be a similar orange color like the one at the border. The blue color has high contrast with the orange color and made him think it was filled in. He suggested to make the contrast lower so that it shows that the field is just greyed out.</p>
            <h1>3. Would this be a survey that you would be willing to fill out and why?</h1>
            <p>Lim said no because she didnâ€™t know what it is.</p>
            <p>Jiayi responded yes because it looks more interesting and is better than plain and empty forms. The latter does not give rise to a lot of interest. This is more like filling out a game and is more fun.</p>
            <p>Darren replied yes and said the questions seemed business oriented. All the contents can change, the current view is just a template. Darren said as a survey experience, this is more improved than google forms, and each stage question is a big differentiating factor.</p>
        
            <h1>Improvements</h1>
            <p>I plan on adding next questions on the right side of the webpage to fill out the empty negative spaces. The non-active question sections would be greyed out and the active ones would have full opacity/color. I also plan on integrating a process bar at the bottom of the survey form. The form field colors also need to be changed to one with lower contrast with the surroundings. Furthermore, I would like to add an overlay as an introduction to the context of the survey.</p>
