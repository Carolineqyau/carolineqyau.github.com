                <h3>Problem</h3>
            
                <p>We have often experienced being busy dealing with urgent work and putting off what’s important in the long term. President Eisenhower once said, “I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.” I want to create an app that represents the Eisenhower Matrix, and help users to manage tasks and be efficient.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Needs: </b>Find time to complete small milestones leading to the long term goal. Delegate low-priority tasks to others to complete. </li>
                <li><b>Goals: </b>Get a job, find time to prepare for GRE, strategic planning of the department’s long term goals.</li>
                <li><b>Painpoints: </b>A lot of busy work that needs to be done and procrastinated time spent on TV etc. Find it difficult to manage steps to long term goals. A lot of busy work is not important and wastes time.</li>

Help users identify unimportant tasks that should be avoided or delegated.</p><p>Users can pick appropriate time slots to dedicate that time for long term goals. The app has default modes that provide pre-filled information for the user for common tasks such as GRE preparation, which skips the long haul of entering information with fewer steps.</p></div>

            <h3>Trend</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use this app as a supplement to their currently existing organization apps.</li>
                <li>Used for important matters, not so much for the unimportant row.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Things that people liked</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Task divider.</li>
                <li>Auto subtask generation and reminder that helps them build towards the bigger goal.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Features wanted</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A casual notes section.</li>
                <li>Chrome extension and compatibility with other organization apps.</li>
                <li>Subtasks for essay.</li>
                <li>More view options, like calendar time block.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Critiques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is too binary to put things as important/nonimportant.</li>
                <li>Standalone app will not be useful, compatibility with other calendar apps is wanted.</li>
                <li>Delegate and delete tasks will not be used as often as the important row.</li>

                <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                <p>I tested for 3 prototyped user tasks with 7 users, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p><b>Task 1: </b>Return to "Tasks" screen and add a new event.</p>
                    <p><b>Task 2: </b>Navigate between major homescreens of the app.</p>
                    <p><b>Task 3: </b>Add and edit details of a new event from the Calendar screen.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>Upon testing the prototype with 7 users, most were confused by the
                two date/time related fields, one at the top (about duration as start
                and end date) and the other at the bottom (as time blocks used for
                commitment).</p>
                <div class="prototype">
                    <img src="images/eisenhower-research1.jpg" alt="User Research Screen 1">

                    <img src="images/eisenhower-research3.jpg" alt="User Research Screen 3">
                </div>
                <h3>Task List</h3>
                    <p>I asked each user to add an event at the calendar
                    view screen named “Apply to Jobs” with 3 tasks
                    (including Finding Job Postings, Get Referrals,
                    Update Portfolio) to the eisenhower matrix as a
                    “DO” priority and set the time block of “Find Job
                    Postings” task as Mondays Wednesdays 7-8pm,
                    and “Get Referrals” task as Thursdays Saturdays
                    7-8pm.</p>
                <h3>Tester Profile</h3>
                <p>The user testing demographic details are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age ranges from 21 to 55, average 26 years old</li>
                    <li>Highly educated, most are in the process of completing or have completed a bachelor's degree</li>
                    <li>All have a smartphone and try out new apps regularly</li>
                    <li>Have a tight schedule with many tasks</li>
                    <li>Have had experience using a planner or some type of calendar app</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Usability Problems</h2>
                <h3>Common User Errors I Observed</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clicking the wrong area and getting confused by what a particular field is about.</li>
                    <li>Not being able to find the calendar screen, failing to connect the icon to the word “calendar”.</li>
                    <li>Pressing + button before filling out the task in the 2 default tasks list. Leaving out time blocks as empty and unfilled.</li>
                    <li>Not seeing the settings button and “done” button at the bottom because of not scrolling to the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Leaving out time blocks as empty and unfilled.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>User Painpoints</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is not an option to just have an event list as one single day instead of a range.</li>
                    <li>Not sure what Eisenhower matrix is about, still pretty confused. Consider adding guides at the introduction screen to explain each functionality and make the app more accessible. Consider older audiences that may not be so tech savvy.</li>
                    <li>Don’t see social media or share button or send email button, not very convenient.</li>
                    <li>Change the calendar setting as one single line instead of two, it is confusing.</li>
                    <li>Can’t find where to add an event. The + button is at the top of the screen and the calendar icon is at the bottom of the screen, it is confusing.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>User Feedback</h3>
                <p>About what was useful in performing the task:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The divisions are pretty clear.</li>
                    <li>Color scheme is visually pleasing, and it functionally marks the priority of each event.</li>
                    <li>The purple calendar title at the top beneath the overlay indicates which section of the page I am currently in, which is helpful.</li>
                    <li>The grey color indicates those are default fields that have not been activated or filled.</li>
                    <li>The colors show which fields I have edited and are done.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Usability Problems with the Design</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Date and day settings are confusing, why are they divided into two sections?</li>
                    <li>Tapping one task makes it grey, unsure what that means.</li>
                    <li>Not sure if supposed to fill out every field or it is just selective.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Add a small line of text beneath the icons to improve usability.<br>Add introductory guides to assist users to learn how to use this app.<br>Have the eisenhower matrix introduction page be easily accessible from the main page to let users know what this is about.</p>

                <h3>Part 2: Add Event Screen</h3>
                <p>Make the design similar to Airbnb where when you tap into one field you can set the date and duration, or just have users choose when they want to commit their time at the first date setting instead of dividing it into two like Google Calendar.<br>Users didn’t know that you could scroll down the add event page, have an arrow or bar or animation that signifies the page is scrollable.<br>Keep the date and day settings consistent at one place, or have a mark that explains what they do.<br>Only make the must-filled fields grey and others hidden and collapsed.</p>
