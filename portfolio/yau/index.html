            Hello! Iâ€™m Caroline Yau, a second year design & quantitative psychology double major aspiring to become a UX Designer. I used to be a biological sciences and computer science double major, but I realized that coding is not what I wanted to do. I have always had a passion and love in art and design, and finally had the courage to switch paths and follow my passion winter quarter 2019. I am really excited to integrate design ideas into coding.
