            Ever since I could hold a pen, I couldnâ€™t stop drawing. Art is an important part of my life, a window of self expression and connecting to others. As it takes form as design, even more ideas and creativity can be presented. I started playing basketball in 8th grade and fell in love with the sneakers culture, and I integrated design into customizing sneakers for my friends. I am planning on expanding this to a business soon!
