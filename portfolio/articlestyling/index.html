            <p>Imagination is the theme of this pen artwork. I drew a deer surrounded by flowers having branches and blossoms growing from its antlers. On its antlers, there are butterflies that create a magical atmosphere. I decided to use pen for this artwork to present as many details as possible, and fill the entire drawing with objects leaving less space, to reflect the idea of imagination being crowded in the brain and that there is a need for release The imagination that flowed out is presented as the plants and butterflies that “grow” from the deer into different directions.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I was originally planning on drawing the deer in a forest surrounded by animals and flowers in a large scale on a big piece of watercolor paper, however, drawing details with pen on such a large piece of paper wastes a lot of ink and is also difficult to do, therefore I changed it to a smaller piece of paper so I can focus more on the details rather than filling up empty spaces. I was originally thinking of creating this painting completely using watercolor, but then I thought it would be cool to use a fine pen to emphasize the fur of the deer and flower details surrounding it. The focus of the painting is the details all over the drawing. To preserve the strong value contrast between black and white, I decided to not use watercolor over it.</p>
