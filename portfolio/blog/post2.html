        <p>I chose a style that is very minimalistic and simplistic because I wanted to put emphasis on only the essential elements of the website. I drew inspiration from Apple’s website design for a clean, professional and tech layout. The gradient I chose reflects Apple’s wallpapers and the cool tone also reflects technology.</p>
        <p>I chose Helvetica Neue for the majority of the font, altering only to boldface or italics. As for the h1 heading and my name at the footer, I used a more stylistic font “Daniel Black” to grab the audience’s attention and add some playful disruption to the monotoned Helvetica font family.</p>
        <p>I separated the nav bar, body and footer sections by the background color (black/white/black). Within the nav bar, I differentiated the tab that the viewer is on by bolding the list item.</p>
        <p>Throughout my design, I did not add underline for any links (read more, valid HTML5) and used only color to show its link property to keep the design clean. The h2 headings for the article titles and dates are italicized to differentiate from the teasers.</p>
        <p>The difficulty designing the desktop version was that I was kind of trapped by how websites should look like and did not have much innovation to the layouts, perhaps due to the amount of space available. When designing the mobile sites, there was this challenge of not having enough space to allocate the items on the screen, so I had to come up with creative ways of fitting the gradient image and navigation bar.</p>
