        <h2>History of Internet</h2>
        <time datetime="2020-05-06">May 6th, 2020</time>
        <p>"Pizza was the first thing purchased on internet" intrigued me the most. When I did some research, however, the first item sold online was actually marijuana in 1972 by Stanford students using the Arpanet account.</p>
        <p>Online business and shopping has become so convenient to our lives that many stores are only online and don't even have actual shops. Due to COVID-19, most of us are staying home and avoiding going outside.</p>
        <p>Online shopping has therefore become more prevalent to our lives, and the possible items that we could buy has also expanded. Aside from clothes, makeup and electronics, we can also have groceries delivered to our doorstep. This makes it much safer for individuals who don't have access to masks, gloves and disinfectants that are more prone to getting the coronavirus.</p>
        <p>As the quarantine time goes on, I expect more innovations on online business with much wider variety, creativity, business models and design. </p>
