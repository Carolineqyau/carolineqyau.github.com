            I am aspiring to becoming a UX Designer. Access to the internet is a powerful tool for absorbing knowledge, building gaps between people from around the world (especially important during quarantine!) and it is a incredible way of presenting yourself and connecting to other people that have similar minds/aesthetics/interests; this can also be commercialized -- incredible way of presenting products and reaching customers that would be interested and would enjoy the products, and a good interaction design would highly facilitate this feature. Psychology is also so interesting as it dives into why and how people behave in different settings and dissect them into precise theories and explanations. <br>I want to become a UX designer that balances design, usability, functionality and creativity knowing the psychology of users.
